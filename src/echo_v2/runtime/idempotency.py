"""Idempotency support for the runtime executor.

When a caller supplies an ``idempotency_key`` and an :class:`IdempotencyStore`
to :func:`echo_v2.runtime.executor.execute`, the runtime caches terminal
outcomes (successes, permanent failures, and indeterminate outcomes) so that
repeat calls with the same key short-circuit, and concurrent duplicates wait
for the owner to finish and share its result.

The store protocol carries an ``owner_token`` so that a persistent
implementation (Postgres) can enforce **fencing**: every owner write
(``put_success`` / ``put_failure`` / ``put_indeterminate`` / ``release`` /
``renew_lease``) is token-guarded, so a slow prior owner whose lease expired
and was reclaimed by a new owner cannot overwrite the new owner's outcome.
``reserve()`` returns a :class:`ReserveResult` carrying both the
:class:`ReserveStatus` and, on ``ACQUIRED``, the ``owner_token`` the caller
must present on every subsequent write for that key.

The default :class:`InMemoryIdempotencyStore` coordinates concurrent callers
within a single Python process via per-key :class:`asyncio.Future` objects and
honors the same token contract, so runtime tests exercise the real protocol.

Idempotency keys are treated as opaque strings by the runtime. Callers are
responsible for globally meaningful, namespaced keys, e.g.
``green:send:{user_id}:{logical_message_id}``. The critical word is *logical
message ID*, not request attempt ID: all retries/restarts of the same logical
send must use the same key. Unrelated operations must not share a key.

Outcomes are composed of plain, serializable data (strings, ints, floats) —
never exception objects — so that Postgres/Redis serialization and replay
across process boundaries and code versions remain tractable.
